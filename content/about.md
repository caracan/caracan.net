I work for [Red Hat]((https://redhat.com/en)) in the UK as a Solution Architect.  This site is my ramblings on things I do so I can come back to it later rather than having to use grep on my bash history!

Expect some examples and tutorial like docs as I play with new things, as always with tech things on the internet check the date, things move fast and get out of date even faster!

The blog is created using the static site generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) using the [hyde-y](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-y/) theme. I'm not much good at any UI/Design so I am standing on shoulders of people who are.
