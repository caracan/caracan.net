This is the first post in my new blog. A while ago I figured that living I was living via my bash and browser historys. I thought it might be a good idea to clone that into a blog so I can come back to it at a later date.

As of writing this I work for [Red Hat]((https://redhat.com/en)) in the UK as a Solution Architect. This means I get to play with a lot of the new stuff as it arrives, I'm bad at writing down what I do so this is an attempt to try and be better! Expect some examples and tutorial like docs as I play with new things, as always with tech things on the internet check the date, things move fast and get out of date even faster!
